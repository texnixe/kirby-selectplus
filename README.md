# Kirby Selectplus Field

This field adds an add button to a select field that allows you to add new options to a select field on the fly. It is only intended to work with select fields that query subpages of a given folder.

Example use case: In an event page, you have a select field that allows you to select a location. Locations are stored as subpages of the locations page. It may happen that when you create a new event, the location you want to select doesn't exist yet. Usually, you would then have to go to the locations page and add a new location, then go back to your event page and select the new location. With this field, you can do this right from the event page.

locations:

    formfields:
      title:
        label:
          en: Name of Event Location
          de: Name des Veranstaltungsort
        placeholder:
          en: Location Name
          de: Veranstaltungsort
        required: true  
      address:
        label:
          en: Address of Location
          de: Adresse des Veranstaltungsortes
        placeholder:
          en: Address
          de: Adresse
    parent: locations
    template: location
    width: 1/3
    options: query
    query:
      page: locations
      fetch: children
      value: '{{uid}}'
      text: '{{title}}'
 ```

### Formfields option

The formfields option accepts a set of fields that you want to have in your form. For each form field, you can set a label, a placeholder and a required attribute. Each field is a standard text input field. While you can create as many fields as you want, one or two should actually be sufficient to create a new option on the fly.

### Parent
The name of the parent page where the options will be created. The page must exist.

### Options query text

The field you show as text for the select option should be a required field in your formfields options, otherwise your select field option will show an empty string, usually, this will be the title.
